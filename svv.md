## svv05

- safety = finately checked
- liveness = chould check to to infinity

<!-- -->

- trace equivalent TS satisfy the same LT properties
- safety properties *nothing bad will happen*
- liveness properties *something good will happen*

<!-- -->

- $E$ is called an invariant if there exists a propositional formula $\Phi$ (called *invariant condition*) over $AP$ such that (pag 152)




## svv06

- safety properties - find a counterexample (a finate string)
- safety properties are easely checked at finate time

<!-- -->

- every invariant is a safety property
- *empty* is a safety property (because everything is wrong)
