Dear Professor Rosemary Monahan,

my name is Matteo Giorgi and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Pisa.

I am currently finishing my bachelor (I should discuss my final thesis by the end of next spring) and I intend to continue my studies with a master's degree.

Looking around, I have understood the MSc by research in Computer Science at the University of Maynooth could be an excellent choice for my future: it is very interesting the work you and the Principles of Programming Research Group are doing. For this reason, I would like to ask if there might be the possibility you could accept me as a student.

I am always available for an interview or any other information/details.

Thank you very much for your time.
Best regards,
Matteo Giorgi.
