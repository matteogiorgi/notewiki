### INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICS (6 ECTS)

The course provides a systematic introduction to the principles of classical physics. Verification of understanding of the concepts is based on simple applications requiring elementary knowledge of algebra, geometry and occasionally mathematical analysis. Topics covered in the course are: description of some fundamental interactions in nature (gravitational and electrical interaction); laws of motion (derived from Newton's principles); concepts of work and energy; principles of conservation of energy and momentum; angular quantities and some mention of rigid-body dynamics; magnetic field and its effect on moving charges. Special emphasis throughout the course is given to the numerical description of physical phenomena and their representation by mathematical models. The possibilities and limitations of describing the evolution of some simple physical systems by ordinary differential equations are discussed. Of the little mathematical theory needed and not known from mathematical analysis, results are given in a form directly usable for the discussion of the systems studied.\
