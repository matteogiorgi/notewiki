I’ve used Qtile for a while and I can tell it’s a good window manager; it has its source code and config file written in Python, plus a neat documentation comes in support if you fancy to play with it. The only problem imo is stability: in more than one occasion I had to deal with issues appearing just because of last updates.

```c
int main (void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

So I decided to change and I knew exactly what I wanted: my new window manager had to be dynamic (I like my windows layouts to be preconfigured just like in Qtile), had to integrate its own bar and a usable default config to start with (I didn’t have much time for tinkering), plus It would be great if it had good documentation too.

> The choices narrowed to dwm, Xmonad, Awesome and the latter seems perfect for the job: I am no Lua programmer but with no effort the wm is configured and it flies. Awesome!
